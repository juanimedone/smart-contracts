# Ethereum vs Polkadot

## Ethereum 

### Main Characteristics
- **Launched:** 2015 (by Vitalik Buterin and others).
- **Purpose:** General-purpose blockchain platform for dApps.
- **Smart Contracts:** Written mainly in **Solidity** or **Vyper**.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Proof of Stake (PoS) after The Merge (formerly Proof of Work).
- **Network Structure:** Single main chain (**Layer 1**) with Layer 2 scaling solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync).
- **Token Standardization:** Introduced ERC standards (ERC-20, ERC-721 for NFTs, etc.).
- **Developer Ecosystem:** Largest and most mature, with massive tooling (Hardhat, Truffle, Foundry).
- **Security:** Very strong, but because of its size, it's a frequent target for attacks.

### Limitations
- **Scalability:** Limited transactions per second (around 15-30 TPS on mainnet).
- **Gas Fees:** Can become very high during network congestion.
- **Interoperability:** Native interoperability between different blockchains is limited (relies on bridges).
- **Upgrade Speed:** Protocol upgrades are complex and slow due to decentralization and size.

## Polkadot

### Main Characteristics
- **Launched:** 2020 (founded by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum).
- **Purpose:** Platform for building **interconnected blockchains** ("parachains") with shared security.
- **Smart Contracts:** Can be written in **Rust** (via ink!) or **AssemblyScript**.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS).
- **Network Structure:** Central **Relay Chain** coordinating multiple **Parachains**.
- **Interoperability:** Native â€” parachains can seamlessly communicate with each other.
- **Upgradability:** Polkadot supports **forkless upgrades** through on-chain governance.
- **Customization:** Each parachain can be optimized for specific use-cases (DeFi, NFTs, identity, gaming).

### Polkadot Limitations
- **Complexity:** Designing and launching a parachain is much harder than launching a dApp on Ethereum.
- **Parachain Slots:** Limited number of parachain slots available through auctions (can be costly).
- **Adoption:** Smaller developer and user ecosystem compared to Ethereum.
- **Ecosystem Maturity:** Still relatively new; many projects are under heavy development.
